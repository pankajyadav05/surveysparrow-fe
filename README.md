# Task: Design an Architecture for a Survey Company Platform

As a frontend technical architect, your task is to design an architecture diagram for a survey company platform that meets the following requirements:

1. **Landing Page**: The platform should have a landing page that serves as the entry point for users. This page should provide options for users to log in or register.

2. **Login/Register Pages**: The platform should have dedicated pages for user login and registration, allowing new users to create accounts and existing users to authenticate securely.

3. **User Dashboard**: Authenticated users should have access to a personalized dashboard that displays the following information:

   - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
   - Sentiment trends
   - Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores across different regions

4. **Survey Form**: The platform should allow users to fill out survey forms without requiring login or authentication.

5. **High Traffic Handling**: The architecture should be designed to handle high traffic volumes, considering the potential for a large number of concurrent users accessing the platform.

6. **Scalability and Performance**: The architecture should be scalable and optimized for performance to ensure a seamless user experience, even during periods of high traffic.
